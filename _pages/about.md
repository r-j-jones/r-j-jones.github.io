[Curriculum Vitae (CV)](https://r-j-jones.github.io/files/rj_cv_resume_04-2024.pdf)

I'm a third year PhD candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering working under the guidance of Prof. Jeffrey Fessler and Dr. James Balter at the University of Michigan. My research interests include signal and image processing, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computational imaging, inverse problems, and the connections between machine learning and constrained image reconstruction.
